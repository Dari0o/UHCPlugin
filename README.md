How to use: 
Start the round with /uhc start
Set the woldborder with /uhc setborder
Set the uhc spawnpoint with /uhc setlobby
Pvp is deactivated for the first 3 minutes and the border begins to shrink to the set size after 10 minutes (you can change all that in the config file or the code)


How to install: 
to use the plugin try to copy the .jar file into the plugin folder of your minecraft server. 
If this fails, then build the .java file with gradle and copy the build .jar file into the plugins folder.

Note that the plugin is still under development and features might have to be changend in the Java file (build it ,copy it in plugins for changes to take affect) in order for it to work properly.
I also dont take this project very serios, because it was intended for personal use only.
